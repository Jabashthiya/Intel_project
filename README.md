Problem Statement:
The dataset provided is the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers across different species. The task is to build a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal measurements.

Objective:
Train a classification model to predict the species (variety) of an iris flower based on sepal.length, sepal.width, petal.length, and petal.width.
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
